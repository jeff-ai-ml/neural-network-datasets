- Enhanced caching mechanisms

## 12. Special Instructions for Google Jules

### 12.1 Development Approach
- **Start with Phase 1 (CLI)** - Build a complete working system before moving to UI layers
- **Test each agent individually** before integrating into the LangGraph workflow
- **Use provided sample data** for initial testing, then implement full Confluence integration
- **Implement error handling from the beginning** - don't treat it as an afterthought
- **Write comprehensive docstrings** for all functions and classes

### 12.2 Critical Implementation Notes

#### 12.2.1 Confluence API Integration
```python
# Use atlassian-python-api library - it's more reliable than requests
from atlassian import Confluence

# Always handle API rate limits and connection errors
# Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
# Cache page content locally to reduce API calls during development
```

#### 12.2.2 Customer Name Extraction (CRITICAL)
The customer name patterns are:
- `Customer <<Customer name>>`
- `Customer name <<Customer name>>`
- `Customer Name : Customer name`

**Implementation must handle**:
- Variations in spacing and formatting
- Special characters in customer names like parentheses: "New Bank of People(NBP)"
- Multiple occurrences on the same page

#### 12.2.3 LangGraph Implementation
```python
# Create a state management system for agent communication
from typing import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    query: str
    query_type: str  # "counting" or "non_counting" 
    customer_name: str
    year_filter: str
    search_results: List[Dict]
    bug_analysis: Dict
    final_response: str
    page_references: List[str]

# Each agent should update the state and pass it to the next agent
```

#### 12.2.4 Vector Database Setup
```python
# ChromaDB should store metadata for efficient filtering
metadata_schema = {
    "page_id": str,
    "customer_name": str, 
    "year": str,
    "content_type": str,  # "bug_table", "test_cases", "issue_description"
    "page_url": str
}

# Create separate collections for different content types for better performance
```

#### 12.2.5 Query Processing Priority
**Implement in this order**:
1. Customer extraction and normalization
2. Year/date filtering 
3. Content type identification (bug vs test case vs general)
4. Semantic search with filters
5. Response generation with mandatory source references

### 12.3 Testing Strategy for AI Agents

#### 12.3.1 Create Test Data First
```python
# Before implementing Confluence API, create mock data based on the samples
SAMPLE_PAGES = [
    {
        "title": "NBP Hot Fix", 
        "customer": "New Bank of People(NBP)",
        "year": "2022-2023",
        "content": "... full sample content ..."
    },
    {
        "title": "HR IND Medical Center - HF",
        "customer": "HR IND Medical Center", 
        "year": "2025",
        "content": "... full sample content ..."
    }
]
```

#### 12.3.2 Test Queries to Validate
```python
test_queries = [

### 12.4 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### 12.4.1 Response Formatting
- **ALWAYS** include source page URLs in responses
- **For counting queries**: Count + Summary + Links (mandatory)
- **For bug queries**: Check both bug tables AND test case bug IDs
- **For "no results"**: Return "Unable to find the answer" but provide related info

#### 12.4.2 Data Processing
- Handle HTML content from Confluence (strip HTML tags, preserve structure)
- Parse tables correctly (both bug tables and test case tables)
- Extract dates in various formats (DD-MMM-YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, etc.)
- Normalize customer names for consistent searching

#### 12.4.3 Agent Communication
- Each agent should validate its inputs before processing
- Use type hints and data classes for state management
- Implement proper error propagation between agents
- Log agent decisions for debugging

### 12.5 Performance Optimization Tips
- **Batch embedding operations** - don't embed one text at a time
- **Use connection pooling** for Confluence API calls
- **Implement smart caching** - cache parsed page content, not just raw content
- **Lazy loading** - only load data when actually needed

### 12.6 Development Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Set up the project structure** exactly as specified in section 5.1
2. **Create requirements.txt** with all specified dependencies
3. **Implement configuration management** first (credentials, settings)
4. **Build and test data processing** with sample data
5. **Implement each agent separately** with unit tests
6. **Create LangGraph workflow** to orchestrate agents
7. **Build CLI interface** for Phase 1
8. **Add comprehensive error handling** and logging
9. **Test with real Confluence API** using provided credentials
10. **Optimize and refactor** based on test results

### 12.7 Final Validation Checklist
- [ ] All sample queries return expected results
- [ ] Customer names are correctly extracted and normalized
- [ ] Bug analysis handles both bug tables and test case bug IDs
- [ ] Counting queries include mandatory summaries
- [ ] All responses include source page references  
- [ ] Error cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Code is properly commented and structured
- [ ] Configuration is externalized and secure

This document provides everything needed to implement a fully functional Hot Fix Testing AI Agent system. Focus on building a robust Phase 1 CLI system first, then iterate to add the advanced features in subsequent phases.
